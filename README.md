## Storytime ‚ú®
Following my professional retraining and entry into the Holberton School, I discovered personal difficulties with my time management, concentration and attention span.

I like to have a resource to optimize the way I do things, so I looked for a practical, efficient and mobile tool to help me overcome these difficulties.

This is how I discovered the Pomodoro technique:
The aim is to stay 100% focused on a single task for 25 minutes (called a session).
A short break separates each session. Then a longer break occurs after several sessions. In short, this technique is very simple to use: all you need is a timer and iron discipline! And it‚Äôs extremely effective.

But despite all my testing and research, none of the mobile applications corresponded perfectly to what I wanted: either the timer wasn‚Äôt visual and counting down the seconds made me lose focus, or the sheer number of functions meant I wasted time getting lost in the settings instead of quickly starting my work session‚Ä¶

So naturally I set myself the goal of creating this perfect application, both in design and functionality, to satisfy my perfectionism and to have the ideal tool for learning and becoming a developer.
